Summarising videogame videos (selecting frames which will form a short preview) with help of neural networks
=========================================================

Creating video input sequences to train networks
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Select games which videos you would like to parse from www.plays.tv with **GameStatsParser.py**<br>
>python GameStatsParser.py "League of Legends"
2. Download stats about top n videos and write them down to MongoDb with store_game_videos method in **VideoStatsFetcher**<br>
you need to set up parameters for connection to certain Mongo databse with player data in **settings.py**<br>
>python VideoStatsFetcher.py "League of Legends" 900
3. Create Graph of similar videos (nodes are the videos, connections are jaccard similarites higher than certain threshold, currently 0.5)<br>
and save it in py2neo/neo4j format with fill_similarities_graph method in **VideoStatsFetcher**<br>
4. Create a dataframe containing all video Id's and ratings for each video sequence of any length with **VideoSequenceCreation.py**<br>
every next video in sequence must be the one with the highest hashtag-based Jaccard similarity form **similarities.py**<br>
>python VideoSequenceCreation.py "League of Legends"
5. Take frames from a particular video sequence(s) and assign rating to each frame **VideoProcessing.py** <br>
>python VideoProcessing.py "League of Legends" "0, 1"
6. Generate features for each frame using a pretrained image processing neural network. [TF feature extractor](https://github.com/tomrunia/TF_FeatureExtraction) can generate frame-level features with a number of of models, including GoogleNet, Inception, ResNet etc. <br>
7. Convert file generated by TF_feature_extractor to a file in the format accepted by vsLSTM and dppLSTM with **convertToFEformat.py** <br>
8. Train vsLSTM or dppLSTM network from zhang2016video <br>, you can get our example adjusted for custom datasets from [Vlads repository](https://github.com/Vladimir84/Video-Summarization-with-LSTM)
